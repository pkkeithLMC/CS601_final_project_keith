                        <p>
                            Located in Langdon, NH, our farm encompasses 22 acres, with around 5 acres dedicated to open
                            fields. Historically, these upper fields were used for grazing sheep from a farm located at
                            the base of the hill.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since acquiring the property in 2014, we've focused on sustainable agriculture. It began
                            with raising chickens for eggs and later expanded to include seasonal meat bird production.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A few years ago, we introduced Icelandic Sheep to the farm. This hardy and versatile breed
                            provides both quality meat and wool. Currently, we have five ewes, a ram, and a wether (a
                            castrated ram) grazing our pastures. This year, we welcomed ten lively lambs, adding a new
                            dimension to our farming endeavors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our farm is a testament to the enduring connection between stewardship and sustainability.
                            It's a place where history meets the present, and where the land and its inhabitants thrive
                            in unison. We look forward to continuing this legacy for generations to come.
                        </p>
