                <h1>Philosophy of Education</h1>
                <h2>Understanding your students is paramount to productive education.</h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that to educate students, a teacher must consider the students’ past performance and
                    learning profile. A large majority of students have not had their learning styles, learning
                    disabilities and learning profile taking into consideration. To understand how to help students make
                    progress, I must understand the primary barrier to their acquisition of new skills. I document the
                    students learning profile by identifying the students’ neurodevelopmental strengths and weaknesses
                    and find ways to leverage the student’s strengths to overcome areas of weakness. I use that
                    information to demystify the learning process with the students, differentiate their instruction and
                    teach them how to modify a lesson that does not meet their individual needs into a lesson that
                    engages their strengths.
                </p>
                <h2>Mathematics/CS education requires a solid foundation.</h2>
                <p>
                    Mathematics/CS is inherently very abstract, and as a mathematician and CS professional, I am very
                    comfortable with this level of abstraction. However, many students are not and require a grounding
                    of the concepts in the real world. I believe that the introduction of new material should begin with
                    concrete examples, move to representative problems and finally implement the abstract. I also
                    promote good problem solving strategies, reasonableness testing and answer checking techniques. I
                    don’t consider a problem complete unless a student has determined if their answer is reasonable and
                    have checked their answer.
                </p>
                <h2>Learning Mathematics/CS is a process of making connections.</h2>
                <p>
                    A good mathematician and computer scientist has a toolkit full of procedures and techniques that
                    they use to solve problems. A part of learning to solve new problems involves showing students how
                    to use the tools that they already know in a different order or in a different way. When teaching a
                    new objective, I always highlight these connections or compare/contrast this objective to a previous
                    skill. I improve their problem solving abilities by working on pattern recognition so that when they
                    encounter a new problem, they can apply the skills in their toolkit because they recognize that they
                    have seen something similar before.

                <h1>Flipped Classroom Video Example</h1>
                <p>Many of my classes are based on the flipped classroom model.  Students will review content prior to coming to class, so there is no inclass lecture.  
                    Instead we work on projects during class.  Here is an example of a lecture for one of the lessons in the Embedded Systems class.</p>
